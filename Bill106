EXPLANATORY NOTE
The major elements of the Bill are described below.
SCHEDULE 1
AMENDMENTS TO THE CONDOMINIUM ACT, 1998 AND OTHER AMENDMENTS
Condominium Act, 1998
The main changes are to the following Parts of the Act.
Part I.1 (ss. 2-4)
A new Part I.1 allows the Lieutenant Governor in Council to designate a not-for-profit corporation as the condominium authority and to specify provisions of the Act and the regulations made under the Act whose administration is delegated to the condominium authority.
The Part includes mechanisms for government oversight, including requirements for an administrative agreement between the condominium authority and the Minister, annual and other reports by the authority, competency criteria for board members and oversight by the Auditor General.
The condominium authority is not an agent of the Crown. Employees of the authority are not Crown employees. There is no Crown liability for actions of the authority and the authority is required to indemnify the Crown for damages or costs.
The condominium authority is able to set forms and fees and to assess corporations and new owners with respect to the authority’s expenses and expenditures, in accordance with processes and criteria approved by the Minister.
Part I.2 (ss. 5, 6)
If the condominium authority is designated under Part I.1, a new Part I.2 establishes a Condominium Authority Tribunal for the resolution of disputes primarily between condominium corporations and owners or mortgagees. The condominium authority appoints members of the Tribunal, as well as a chair and vice-chairs.
A corporation, owner, mortgagee or purchaser can apply to the Tribunal for a resolution of particular disputes prescribed by the regulations. Certain disputes are excluded, including disputes involving Part III (Ownership), liens and the determination of title to real property. The Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to exercise its powers. Appeals on questions of law go to the Divisional Court.
Part II (ss. 7-11)
The form and content of declarations are subject to the regulations. Certain mandatory contents are set out in the Act, including a new requirement for a statement of how the proportions of each owner’s common expenses and common interests are determined. A declaration may contain additional information permitted under the Act and the regulations, including conditions or restrictions with respect to the occupation, use, maintenance and repair of assets of the corporation and statements regarding the common expenses and circumstances that may result in additions to an owner’s obligation to contribute to the common expenses.
Part II.1 (s. 12)
A new Part II.1 requires corporations to file returns with the Condominium Registrar and to notify the Registrar of any change in directors. The Registrar and deputy Registrars are appointed by the condominium authority if the authority is delegated responsibility for this Part. Otherwise, they are appointed by the Minister. False, misleading or missing statements in a return give rise to an offence under the Act. The Part provides for the confidentiality of information collected, with certain exceptions.
Part III (ss. 13, 14)
The regulations can specify property that is to be an asset of the corporation or form part of the common elements and specify rules and procedures regarding this allocation of property. A regulation regarding the allocation of property does not apply if the board of directors of a corporation decides otherwise in cases where the board is not controlled by the declarant and meets the other requirements of the Act.
Part IV (ss. 15-58)
A corporation is prohibited from levying fines, penalties or other amounts against owners, occupiers or other prescribed persons, unless it is to compensate or indemnify the corporation for an actual loss as prescribed or doing so is otherwise permitted under the Act.
Corporations, declarants and other persons who have shared use or obligations in relation to land, a condominium property, assets of a corporation and other facilities or services are required to enter into an agreement.  The regulations can set out what the agreements must contain and can provide for circumstances where no agreement is required.
An owner in arrears of common expenses for 30 days or more is not entitled to consent to any of the following until the owner pays the arrears: amendments to a declaration or description, the termination of certain telecommunications agreements in relation to a condominium property, the dispensing with an audit, the amalgamation of corporations or the sale of any of their exclusive use common elements.
A corporation that has unpaid fees, costs, charges or assessments under Part I.1 or I.2 is not entitled to maintain a proceeding before the Condominium Authority Tribunal or in an Ontario court except with leave of the court.
A corporation is not required to make payment to acquire an interest in any property until a board of directors of the corporation that is not controlled by the declarant decides otherwise or unless the regulations provide otherwise. Similarly, no provision of a declaration, by-law, agreement or other instrument affects a remedy that a corporation has against a declarant or related persons unless that board of directors of the corporation decides otherwise.
Corporations are required to periodically provide prescribed information, including insurance updates, to the owners. Corporations are prohibited from entering into certain contracts unless the required procurement process has been followed.
The qualifications and disqualifications for being the director of a corporation are expanded to include disclosure obligations and required training.
Board meetings can be held by teleconference or another form of communication system if all directors consent. Protection from liability for directors and officers is expanded to cover cases where the individual relies in good faith on a report or opinion of a reserve fund study provider.
Upon becoming an owner, the owner is required to notify the corporation of the owner’s name and to identify the owner’s unit. An owner may, but is not required to, notify the corporation of the owner’s address for service.
The Schedule changes procedural requirements for the calling and holding of owners’ meetings.
